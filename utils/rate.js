Mainly, the text looking big red and black boxes with hints of orange. However, I am aware that there was not much you could have solved in that department so I did not fault you too much for that, you did what you could have there. Secondly, there is no watermark (I will flip). Third off, the "KMS Roon", "Normal Meelee Attacks" and "Special Meelee Attacks" are too dark. Perhaps changing the shade of red to make it glow more perchance. It sounds like I do not have anything noteworthy to say about the design of this card, which is incorrect. I very much appreciate your time and effort that you have put into the icons here. For that, thank you)(Good, needs lots of nerfs. Such as, cooldowns and about of dmg certain attacks do)']],

Next, the card type on the bottom is a cool idea, might fit your card style cant see it being incoorporated to something like mine which is probably reaching the end of its evolution. my other issue is the fact that it looks like one of those fucking old amadeo cards, nothing like the renowned tardigrada or the spertozoid fucker pink nigga from steven universe,it looks as if old kai and saxton hale had a child and the child was nigerian. and my last issue is the lack of contrast in the design,literally, because its so bleak theres barely any sort of contrast in the card to make it stand out.\nB8: balanced, cant say much here.\nC9: average amadeo card,usually creative, cant say shit here either,but some moves feel repeated from other cards."]],
