Secondly, there is no watermark (I will flip). Third off, the "KMS Roon", "Normal Meelee Attacks" and "Special Meelee Attacks" are too dark. Perhaps changing the shade of red to make it glow more perchance. It sounds like I do not have anything noteworthy to say about the design of this card, which is incorrect. I very much appreciate your time and effort that you have put into the icons here. For that, thank you)(Good, needs lots of nerfs. Such as, cooldowns and about of dmg certain attacks do)']],

    ["rengoku_flamehashira",[8,4,7,"eno","Design is a 8 and Creativity is a 7 \nNow let me get to the balance\nTotal Balance Dissection (Passives) : Indomitable will stacks up infinitely and the buffs are permanent theoretically you could revive him and the fact that you have to take dmg wont matter.\nKeen Intellect is just a general dmg and defensive buff with no prerequisite or downside.\nSpeed and Reflexes is just “how do i make my card impossible to kill” so not only do you get debuffs on the first move you land but also on the first move that hits him? “Cannot be hit by surprise attacks” Alright do i even need to say anything? This is just bullshit and ruins mechanics of multiple cards.\nExtrasensory perception is just the nail in the coffin now your general abilities will deal a total of no damage and even if you were to remove the passive above you still get the “unable to surprise attack” even though it was already mentioned that enemies couldnt? The demon and bleed thing is passable.\nWarriors spirit. Let me get this straight. He gets buffed under 300hp and you added the “buff under 40% hp” but im DISSECTING the card so i noticed. Its a buff at 200HP which makes him now straight up bullshit to fight against. Unmovable untouchable and infinite strength stacking. Utter bullshit.\nTotal Dissection (Abilities): \nUnknowing fire: net 8 for 25dmg seems fair right? Then you read more and you see 10 burn, chainable and free luck gain which in addition to the passives above can grant you more than enough types of buffs that allow you to more than just land moves. Now this move is chainable with rss which is also a bit batshit.\nRising Scorching Sun: catches enemies mid air i like to see that finally be used somewhere other than my cards. 40dmg more luck stacking again (unnecessary) and same burn infliction. But it is chainable AGAIN.\nBlazing Universe: breaks parries and blocks not terrible but still annoying. Applies burn and 2 counter dice. Ability itself is fine but of course its in a 3 hour long multiplication combo which inflicts a total of 30 burn and i dont even have to mention the rolls because you can deadass just leave him to die and you can gather so much strength you just can ignore the rolls. \nLets get to the specials\nBlooming Flame: this shit has two functions. A parry and an attack. Funny thing is you roll it 4 times and you inflict 1 immobilize per hit. Luckily josh raped immobilize so its only 2 per character. Problem is he attacks MULTIPLE AT ONCE. And all of this on a 2 round cooldown wow.\nFlame tiger:duel mechanic. Would be fine if it didnt fucking deal 160dmg and a buttload of burn. 4rc is at least manageable\nNinth form: oh my days. Instant dmg plus the passives make this ability insta hit. Also because the point of this unit is to lower hp as fast as possible to use passives makes it even worse that he can attack multiple enemies. He gains MORE attack power if the enemy has burn and rolls even less if he is about to die. And permanent burn? Im sorry but this would be fine if it was lower than 20.\nFinal Balance rating of 4\nSinglehandedly makes burn the most op status ingame not because of infliction but because of buff stacking and being pretty much impossible to kill\nNeeds an nerf in my opinion and the B4 is beyond fair in my opinion"]],
