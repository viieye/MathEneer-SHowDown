Secondly, there is no watermark (I will flip). Third off, the "KMS Roon", "Normal Meelee Attacks" and "Special Meelee Attacks" are too dark. Perhaps changing the shade of red to make it glow more perchance. It sounds like I do not have anything noteworthy to say about the design of this card, which is incorrect. I very much appreciate your time and effort that you have put into the icons here. For that, thank you)(Good, needs lots of nerfs. Such as, cooldowns and about of dmg certain attacks do)']],
