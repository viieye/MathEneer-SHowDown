instructions:
for now use the the UXDoM_viewer.exe.html to open the actual html, it will redirect,

if you have images folder, provide the utils/img/linker.js with the link to it in format:
const linker="[link to your MEXD_files directory here]"
---
if youre storing it on c disk, in documents its gonna be:
C:/Users/X/Documents/MEXD_files/
youre free to replace images if you want, its like resource packs
(there might be some actual resource pack support)

future plans:
rater ranks, promoting rating more often
boss and item section galleries
to fix bugs with items,
adding char entities on board, coupled with client version
adding instructions for the search bar


igen thats it for now
