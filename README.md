instructions:
for now use the the UXDoM_viewer.exe.html to open the actual html, it will redirect,

images folder and linker.js
---
if you have images folder, provide the utils/img/linker.js with the link to it in format:
const linker="[link to your MEXD_files directory here]/" (dont forget the slash at the end)

if youre storing it on c disk, in documents its gonna be:
C:/Users/X/Documents/MEXD_files/ (dont forget the slash at the end)
youre free to replace images if you want, its like resource packs
(there might be some actual resource pack support)
the file structure is something like
- [main directory]/images/mainclass_cards - *for your cards of classess support to legendary*
- [main directory]/images/extraclass_cards - *for your cards of classess such as bosses, MCs and NPCs/events*
- [main directory]/images/item_cards - *for your cards of items*
- [main directory]/images/extra - *for graphic icons and other*

future plans:
---
rater ranks, favourite cards - promoting rating more often
boss and item section galleries
to fix bugs with items,
adding char entities on board, coupled with client version
adding instructions for the search bar


igen thats it for now
